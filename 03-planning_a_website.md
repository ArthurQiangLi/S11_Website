# Planning a website

This is about what content you want to put on a website, what pages you need, and how they should be arranged an link to one another for the best `user expereience`.

> For a large, complex website, a lot of planning can go into this process


> For a simple website of a few pages, this can be fairly simple.


Steps:
1. think of common elements for most/all pages
2. draw a rough sketch for each page on paper
3. brainstorm all other content you want to have on the website
4. sort these content things into groups, like `card sorting`
5. sketch a rough sitemap on paper
